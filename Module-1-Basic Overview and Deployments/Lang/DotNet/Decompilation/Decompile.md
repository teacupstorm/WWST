# Decompilation in .Net 

Dot net uses executable to store functions and classes like a lib. all functions are written in c-sharp and c-sharp converts to executable like DLL or exe (mostly DLL for web). DLL is executable and its not really possible to read it directly we anyhow reverse it to c-sharp code to understand workflow.

to reverse DLL or executable back to c-shrarp there is tool called Dnspy which is the best so far for reversing .net binaryies.
