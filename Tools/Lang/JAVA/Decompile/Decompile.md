# Decompilation in JAVA.
As java creates standalone files AKA executable which can't be readable same as source code or java files

to understand decompilation process we must aware with following formats.

1. .Jar ==> its file format wich contains all classes (like archive)
2. .War ==> its file format which is same as jar however, it just contains web related files.
3. .class ==> its a file format which contains all java files converted into bytecode (java binary)
4. .java ==> its plain human readable format which can be readable by anyone. 

when it comes to getting java code from jar file we have to follow the reverse format java ==> decompress ==> class ==> decompile ==> java

to make things easier there is a tool called JD-Gui which converts jar or class files to java readable code.
